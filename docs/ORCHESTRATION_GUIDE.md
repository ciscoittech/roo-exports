## Roo Code Features Overview

### Custom Modes

Roo Code allows you to create specialized modes that tailor the AI's behavior for specific tasks. Each custom mode is defined in YAML format with these key components:

```yaml
customModes:
  - slug: my-mode-name              # Unique identifier
    name: üéØ Display Name           # Name shown in UI
    roleDefinition: >               # Who the mode is
      You are a specialized...
    whenToUse: >                    # When to use this mode
      Use this mode when...
    description: Short summary      # Brief description
    groups:                         # Tool access permissions
      - read
      - edit
    customInstructions: >           # Detailed instructions
      Your detailed instructions...
    source: project                 # global or project
    rulesFiles:                     # Project-specific rules
      - relativePath: AGENTS.md
        content: >
          Non-obvious rules...
```

### Tool Access Groups

Roo Code has 5 tool groups that control what a mode can do:

| Group | Capabilities | Example Tools |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `read` | Read files, search code | Read, Grep, Glob |
| `edit` | Edit files | Edit, Write, NotebookEdit |
| `browser` | Fetch web content | WebFetch, WebSearch |
| `command` | Execute terminal commands | Bash |
| `mcp` | Use Model Context Protocol integrations | Playwright MCP, custom MCPs |

**Tool Group Combinations:**
- **Full Access:** `[read, edit, browser, command, mcp]` - Can do everything
- **Read-Only:** `[read]` - Analysis and recommendations only
- **Read + Edit:** `[read, edit]` - Can modify files but not execute commands
- **Read + Edit + Command:** `[read, edit, command]` - Development work without browser
- **Review Tools:** `[read, browser, command, mcp]` - Testing and validation (no file edits)

### Boomerang Tasks (Task Orchestration)

**Boomerang Tasks** allow one mode to launch other modes as subtasks and receive their results back.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Orchestrator Mode:** Launches subtasks using `new_task` tool
2. **Specialist Modes:** Execute specific tasks, return results via `attempt_completion`
3. **Result Passing:** Orchestrator receives specialist results and can use them in subsequent tasks

**Syntax:**

```javascript
// Orchestrator launches a specialist
const result = new_task(
  mode: "specialist-mode-slug",
  message: "Task description with context. Use attempt_completion when done."
)

// Specialist completes and returns
// (Inside specialist mode, when task is done)
attempt_completion(
  result: "Detailed results of the work performed..."
)

// Orchestrator receives result and continues
const nextResult = new_task(
  mode: "another-specialist",
  message: `Next task based on previous: ${result}...`
)
```

### Built-in Orchestrator Mode (2025 Update)

Roo Code 3.15+ includes a built-in ü™É **Orchestrator mode** with important constraints:

**What it CAN do:**
- Launch other modes via `new_task`
- Receive results via `attempt_completion`
- Aggregate results into reports
- Make decisions about which specialists to launch

**What it CANNOT do (enforced by Roo Code):**
- Read files directly
- Write or edit files
- Execute terminal commands
- Use MCP servers

**Why this matters:** Orchestrators are **coordinators**, not **executors**. They delegate all actual work to specialist modes.

**Tool Access for Orchestrators:**
- Recommended: `groups: [read]` (minimal, for basic context)
- Some orchestrators: `groups: [read, command]` (if they need to check system state)
- Never: `[edit]` group (orchestrators should never modify files)

## How Orchestration Works

### Orchestrator vs Specialist Pattern

**Traditional Mode Switching (Manual):**
```
User manually switches modes:
1. Switch to Next.js Architect ‚Üí Design component
2. Switch to TDD Engineer ‚Üí Write tests
3. Switch to Code Reviewer ‚Üí Review code
4. User synthesizes results manually
```

**Orchestrator Pattern (Automated):**
```
User uses TDD Frontend Orchestrator once:
1. Orchestrator launches Next.js Architect ‚Üí Receives design
2. Orchestrator launches TDD Engineer ‚Üí Receives tests
3. Orchestrator launches implementation ‚Üí Receives code
4. Orchestrator launches Code Reviewer ‚Üí Receives review
5. Orchestrator aggregates all results ‚Üí Comprehensive report
```

### Sequential vs Parallel Execution

**Sequential Execution** (when tasks depend on each other):
```javascript
// Task 2 needs results from Task 1
const architecture = new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: "Design component architecture..."
)

// Wait for architecture to complete, then use its results
const tests = new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: `Write tests based on: ${architecture}...`
)
```

**Parallel Execution** (when tasks are independent):
```javascript
// These can run simultaneously
const [architecture, security] = Promise.all([
  new_task(mode: "nextjs-architect", message: "Design..."),
  new_task(mode: "code-reviewer", message: "Analyze security...")
])
```

**Example from TDD Backend Orchestrator:**
```javascript
// PARALLEL: Architecture and Database design are independent
const architectTask = new_task(mode: "laravel-architect", ...)
const databaseTask = new_task(mode: "database-engineer", ...)

// SEQUENTIAL: Tests need both architecture AND database to be complete
const tddTask = new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: `Write tests based on:
    Architecture: ${architectTask.result}
    Database: ${databaseTask.result}
  `
)
```

### Result Aggregation

Orchestrators collect results from all specialists and format them into comprehensive reports:

```markdown
# TDD Frontend Development Summary

## RED Phase (Architecture + Tests)
- Architecture: [Results from Next.js Architect]
- Tests Written: [Results from TDD Engineer]

## GREEN Phase (Implementation)
- Implementation: [Results from Next.js Architect]
- Tests Passing: ‚úÖ 25/25

## REFACTOR Phase (Review)
- Code Review: [Results from Code Reviewer]
- Blockers: 0
- High-Priority: 2 (refactored)

## Final Status: Ready for Merge ‚úÖ
```

### Context Passing Between Tasks

**Explicit Context Passing:**
```javascript
// Orchestrator explicitly passes context from previous task
const architecture = new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: "Design user profile component with form validation..."
)

// Context from architecture is embedded in the message
const tests = new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: `Write tests for the following architecture:

  ${architecture}

  Focus on form validation rules...`
)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Be explicit about what context specialist needs
- Include relevant results from previous tasks
- Specify what format you want results in
- Always end specialist messages with "Use attempt_completion when done."

## Roo Code Limitations & Constraints

### 1. Orchestrator Read-Only Constraint (2025)

**Limitation:** Orchestrators with Boomerang Tasks should use `groups: [read]` or `[read, command]` only.

**Why:** Roo Code's built-in Orchestrator mode (3.15+) enforces strict separation between coordination and execution.

**Workaround:** Delegate ALL file operations to specialists:
```javascript
// ‚ùå DON'T: Try to edit files in orchestrator
Edit(file_path: "...", old_string: "...", new_string: "...")

// ‚úÖ DO: Launch specialist to edit files
new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: "Implement the component based on tests. Edit src/components/..."
)
```

### 2. Tool Access Restrictions

**Limitation:** Modes can only use tools in their assigned `groups`.

**Example Issue:**
```yaml
# Orchestrator with only read access
groups: [read]

# This will FAIL because orchestrator can't execute commands
customInstructions: >
  Run tests with: npm test
```

**Workaround:** Delegate to specialist with command access:
```javascript
new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",  // Has [read, edit, command] access
  message: "Run the test suite and report results..."
)
```

### 3. Context Size Limitations

**Limitation:** Very large result strings can hit context limits when passing between tasks.

**Symptoms:**
- Orchestrator truncates results
- Specialist doesn't receive full context
- "Context length exceeded" errors

**Workaround:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå DON'T: Pass entire file contents
const architecture = new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: `Here's the entire codebase: ${allFiles}...`
)

// ‚úÖ DO: Pass summaries and file paths
const architecture = new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: `Design based on existing patterns in:
  - src/components/forms/*.tsx
  - Focus on patterns used in UserForm.tsx

  Summarize key architecture decisions.`
)
```

### 4. Specialist Must Use attempt_completion

**Limitation:** If specialist doesn't call `attempt_completion`, orchestrator never receives results.

**Best Practice:** Always include this instruction:
```javascript
new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: `Your tasks...

  Use attempt_completion when done.  // ‚Üê Critical!`
)
```

### 5. No Real-Time Specialist Monitoring

**Limitation:** Orchestrator can't see specialist's progress in real-time. It waits for final result.

**Implication:** Can't interrupt or modify specialist mid-task.

**Workaround:** Break large tasks into smaller subtasks:
```javascript
// ‚ùå DON'T: Launch one huge task
new_task(message: "Implement entire feature with 20 components...")

// ‚úÖ DO: Break into phases
new_task(message: "Implement core component...")
new_task(message: "Implement form validation...")
new_task(message: "Implement error handling...")
```

## Maximizing Effectiveness

### When to Use Orchestrators

**‚úÖ Use Orchestrators When:**
- **Multi-step workflows:** RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, comprehensive design review
- **Consistent process needed:** Enforce TDD methodology, quality gates
- **Multiple specialists required:** Architecture + Tests + Implementation + Review
- **Parallel execution beneficial:** 6 design reviewers running simultaneously
- **Aggregated reporting desired:** Single comprehensive report from multiple sources

**‚ùå Use Manual Mode Switching When:**
- **Single focused task:** "Write tests for this component"
- **Exploratory work:** Trying different approaches
- **Quick iterations:** Rapid prototyping
- **Learning/debugging:** Understanding how individual modes work
- **Simple one-off tasks:** "Review this file for security issues"

### Structuring Requirements for Best Results

**Poor Requirement (vague):**
```
User: "Build a user profile feature"

Orchestrator: Unclear what to build, which framework, what tests, etc.
```

**Good Requirement (specific):**
```
User: "Build a Next.js user profile edit form with:
- Fields: name, email, bio (textarea)
- Client-side validation (Zod)
- Server Action for submission
- Loading states and error handling
- TypeScript strict mode (no 'any')
- Tests for validation and submission flow"

Orchestrator: Clear requirements, knows exactly what to coordinate
```

**Best Practices for Requirements:**
1. **Specify framework:** Next.js vs React, Laravel vs FastAPI
2. **Define scope:** What features exactly
3. **State constraints:** TypeScript rules, test coverage targets
4. **Identify edge cases:** Error states, loading, empty data
5. **Mention non-functional requirements:** Performance, accessibility

### Debugging Orchestration Workflows

**Issue:** Orchestrator didn't launch expected specialist

**Debug:**
1. Check orchestrator's `customInstructions` - does it have logic to launch that specialist?
2. Check mode slug - is the specialist mode actually imported?
3. Check conditional logic - did orchestrator decide not to launch based on context?

**Issue:** Specialist didn't return results

**Debug:**
1. Did specialist's task message include "Use attempt_completion when done"?
2. Check specialist's tool access - can it actually perform the requested task?
3. Look for errors in specialist's execution

**Issue:** Results not passed to next specialist

**Debug:**
1. Check orchestrator explicitly passes context: `message: \`Based on: ${previousResult}\``
2. Verify previous task completed before next one launched (sequential dependency)

**Issue:** Orchestrator tries to edit files and fails

**Debug:**
1. Check orchestrator's `groups` - should be `[read]` only
2. Move file operations to specialist modes
3. Update orchestrator instructions to delegate file operations

### Performance Optimization

**1. Maximize Parallel Execution:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå SLOW: Sequential when tasks are independent
const interaction = new_task(mode: "interaction-tester", ...)
const responsive = new_task(mode: "responsive-auditor", ...)
const visual = new_task(mode: "visual-reviewer", ...)
// Total time: T1 + T2 + T3

// ‚úÖ FAST: Parallel execution
const results = Promise.all([
  new_task(mode: "interaction-tester", ...),
  new_task(mode: "responsive-auditor", ...),
  new_task(mode: "visual-reviewer", ...)
])
// Total time: max(T1, T2, T3)
```

**2. Minimize Context Size:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå SLOW: Large context passed between tasks
new_task(message: `Full file contents: ${10000_line_file}...`)

// ‚úÖ FAST: Minimal context, let specialist read files
new_task(message: `Review patterns in src/components/forms/*.tsx`)
```

**3. Use Conditional Launching:**
```javascript
// Only launch refactor if needed
if (reviewTask.blockers.length > 0) {
  new_task(mode: "nextjs-architect", message: "Refactor blockers...")
}
// Don't launch if no blockers (saves time)
```

## Practical Workflows

### TDD Frontend Development Workflow

**Mode:** `tdd-frontend-orchestrator`

**User Input:**
```
"Build a product search component with:
- Search input with debounce (300ms)
- Results list with pagination
- Loading spinner
- Empty state for no results
- Error handling for API failures
Using Next.js with TypeScript strict mode"
```

**Orchestrator Execution:**

**Phase 1: RED (Architecture + Tests)**
```javascript
// Step 1: Design architecture
const architecture = new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: "Design product search component architecture..."
)
// Returns: Component structure, TypeScript interfaces, props, state management

// Step 2: Write failing tests
const tests = new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: `Write failing tests for: ${architecture}
  - Test debounce behavior
  - Test pagination
  - Test loading states
  - Test error handling
  - Test empty state`
)
// Returns: Test suite (all failing)
```

**Phase 2: GREEN (Implementation)**
```javascript
// Step 3: Implement to pass tests
const implementation = new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: `Implement component to pass tests:
  Architecture: ${architecture}
  Tests: ${tests}

  Minimum code to pass all tests.`
)
// Returns: Component implementation, all tests passing
```

**Phase 3: REFACTOR (Review)**
```javascript
// Step 4: Code review
const review = new_task(
  mode: "code-health-reviewer",
  message: `Review implementation:
  Code: ${implementation}
  Tests: ${tests}

  Check for: TypeScript quality, component reuse, design tokens`
)
// Returns: Findings (Blocker, High, Medium)

// Step 5: Refactor if needed
if (review.blockers.length > 0 || review.highPriority.length > 0) {
  const refactored = new_task(
    mode: "nextjs-architect",
    message: `Refactor based on review: ${review}`
  )
}
```

**Phase 4: VALIDATE (Optional - UI-heavy features)**
```javascript
// Step 6: Design review (optional)
const designReview = new_task(
  mode: "orchestrator-design-review",
  message: "Run comprehensive design review on product search component"
)
// Launches 6 design specialists in parallel
```

```

### TDD Backend Development Workflow

**Mode:** `tdd-backend-orchestrator`

**User Input:**
```
"Build REST API for blog posts with:
- CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
- Pagination for list endpoint
- Search by title/content
- Published/draft status
- User authentication required
Using Laravel with PostgreSQL"
```

**Orchestrator Execution:**

**Phase 1: FOUNDATION (Architecture + Database)**
```javascript
// Parallel execution - independent tasks
const [architecture, database] = Promise.all([
  new_task(
    mode: "laravel-architect",
    message: "Design API endpoints for blog CRUD..."
  ),
  new_task(
    mode: "database-engineer",
    message: "Design database schema for blog posts..."
  )
])
// architecture returns: API routes, controllers, services, validation rules
// database returns: Migration, model, relationships, indexes
```

**Phase 2: RED (Tests)**
```javascript
const tests = new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: `Write failing tests for blog API:

  API Design: ${architecture}
  Database Schema: ${database}

  Test categories:
  - Feature tests (HTTP endpoints)
  - Unit tests (services)
  - Database tests (models, migrations)
  - Authorization tests (policies)`
)
// Returns: Complete test suite (all failing), target: 80%+ coverage
```

**Phase 3: GREEN (Implementation)**
```javascript
const implementation = new_task(
  mode: "laravel-architect",
  message: `Implement blog API to pass all tests:

  Architecture: ${architecture}
  Database: ${database}
  Tests: ${tests}

  Tasks:
  1. Run migrations
  2. Implement Post model
  3. Implement controllers
  4. Implement services (business logic)
  5. Implement validation (Form Requests)
  6. Implement policies (authorization)
  7. Verify all tests pass`
)
// Returns: Full implementation, migrations applied, tests passing
```

**Phase 4: REFACTOR (Review + Security)**
```javascript
const review = new_task(
  mode: "code-reviewer",
  message: `Review blog API implementation:

  Code: ${implementation}
  Tests: ${tests}

  Focus:
  - Security (SQL injection, XSS, authorization)
  - N+1 query issues
  - Input validation completeness
  - Error handling`
)
// Returns: Security findings, performance issues, code quality

// Refactor if critical issues found
if (review.blockers.length > 0) {
  const refactored = new_task(
    mode: "laravel-architect",
    message: `Fix critical issues: ${review.blockers}`
  )
}
```

**Phase 5: VALIDATE (API Contract + Database)**
```javascript
// Parallel validation - independent checks
const [apiValidation, dbValidation] = Promise.all([
  new_task(
    mode: "tdd-engineer",
    message: "Validate API contract compliance (OpenAPI spec)..."
  ),
  new_task(
    mode: "database-engineer",
    message: "Verify database optimization (no N+1, indexes used)..."
  )
])
```

**Final Output:**
```markdown

### Design Review Workflow

**Mode:** `orchestrator-design-review`

**User Input:**
```
"Run comprehensive design review on the user dashboard at /dashboard"
```

**Orchestrator Execution:**

**Parallel Launch (All Specialists Run Simultaneously):**
```javascript
const results = Promise.all([
  // Specialist 1: Interaction testing
  new_task(
    mode: "interaction-tester",
    message: "Test user flows and interactive states on /dashboard"
  ),

  // Specialist 2: Responsive design
  new_task(
    mode: "responsive-auditor",
    message: "Test /dashboard at 3 viewports: 1440px, 768px, 375px"
  ),

  // Specialist 3: Visual polish
  new_task(
    mode: "visual-reviewer",
    message: "Check visual consistency on /dashboard"
  ),

  // Specialist 4: Accessibility
  new_task(
    mode: "accessibility-auditor",
    message: "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing on /dashboard"
  ),

  // Specialist 5: Robustness
  new_task(
    mode: "robustness-tester",
    message: "Test edge cases and error handling on /dashboard"
  ),

  // Specialist 6: Code health
  new_task(
    mode: "code-health-reviewer",
    message: "Review component reuse and design tokens for /dashboard"
  )
])
// All 6 specialists complete in time of 1 (parallel execution)
```

**Aggregation:**
```javascript
// Orchestrator aggregates findings by priority
const report = aggregateFindings(results)
// Sorts into: Blocker ‚Üí High-Priority ‚Üí Medium-Priority ‚Üí Nitpicks
```

**Final Output:**
```markdown
# Design Review Summary

**Page:** User Dashboard (/dashboard)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Revisions (2 blockers found)

## Priority Findings

### [Blocker] Must Fix Before Merge

1. **Focus States Not Visible (Accessibility)**
   - Issue: Interactive elements have no visible focus indicator
   - WCAG: Violation of 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
   - Screenshot: [evidence.png]
   - Fix: Add `:focus-visible` styles with 3:1 contrast ratio

2. **Horizontal Scrolling on Mobile (Responsive)**
   - Issue: Dashboard table causes horizontal scroll at 375px viewport
   - Impact: Unusable on mobile devices
   - Screenshot: [mobile-scroll.png]
   - Fix: Use responsive table pattern (cards on mobile)

### [High-Priority] Should Fix

3. **Color Contrast Below Minimum (Accessibility)**
   - Issue: Secondary text has 3.2:1 contrast (needs 4.5:1)
   - Location: Sidebar navigation labels
   - WCAG: Violation of 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum
   - Fix: Darken text color from #9CA3AF to #6B7280

4. **Inconsistent Spacing (Visual Polish)**
   - Issue: Card spacing varies (16px vs 20px vs 24px)
   - Impact: Visual inconsistency
   - Fix: Use 8px grid system consistently (16px or 24px only)

### [Medium-Priority] Nice to Have

5. **Component Duplication (Code Health)**
   - Issue: 3 similar card components (DashboardCard, StatCard, InfoCard)
   - Recommendation: Create unified Card component with variants
   - Impact: Easier maintenance

6. **No Empty State (Robustness)**
   - Issue: When user has no data, shows blank space
   - Recommendation: Add empty state illustration + CTA
   - Impact: Better UX

### [Nitpick] Polish

7. **Loading State Duration (Interaction)**
   - Observation: Spinner shows for <200ms (flash effect)
   - Recommendation: Delay spinner appearance until 300ms
   - Impact: Smoother perceived performance

---

## Specialist Summaries

‚úÖ **Interaction Testing:** PASS (after blocker #1 fixed)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Responsive Design:** FAIL (blocker #2 must be fixed)
‚úÖ **Visual Polish:** PASS (high-priority #4 recommended)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Accessibility:** FAIL (blockers #1, high-priority #3)
‚úÖ **Robustness:** PASS (medium-priority #6 recommended)
‚úÖ **Code Health:** PASS (medium-priority #5 recommended)

---

## Go/No-Go Decision

**Status:** üö´ **NOT READY FOR MERGE**

**Reason:** 2 [Blocker] findings must be fixed:
1. Focus states (accessibility violation)
2. Horizontal scrolling (mobile unusable)

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix blocker #1: Add focus styles
2. Fix blocker #2: Implement responsive table
3. Re-run design review to verify fixes
4. Address high-priority findings before final merge
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Nested Orchestration

**Pattern:** Orchestrator launches another orchestrator as a subtask.

**Example:** TDD Frontend Orchestrator optionally launches Design Review Orchestrator

```javascript
// TDD Frontend Orchestrator
const implementation = new_task(
  mode: "nextjs-architect",
  message: "Implement component..."
)

// For UI-heavy features, launch Design Review Orchestrator
if (user.requiresDesignReview) {
  const designReview = new_task(
    mode: "orchestrator-design-review",  // ‚Üê Another orchestrator!
    message: "Run comprehensive design review..."
  )
  // Design Review Orchestrator launches 6 specialists
  // Results bubble back up to TDD Frontend Orchestrator
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Modular orchestration (compose workflows)
- Reusable sub-workflows
- Cleaner separation of concerns

**Limitations:**
- Deeper nesting = longer execution time
- Context passing across multiple levels
- Harder to debug

### Conditional Specialist Launching

**Pattern:** Orchestrator decides which specialists to launch based on context.

**Example:** TDD Backend Orchestrator conditionally launches refactor cycle

```javascript
const review = new_task(
  mode: "code-reviewer",
  message: "Review implementation..."
)

// Only launch refactor if issues found
if (review.blockers.length > 0 || review.highPriority.length > 0) {
  const refactored = new_task(
    mode: "laravel-architect",
    message: `Refactor to address: ${review.findings}`
  )
} else {
  // Skip refactor, move to validation
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster execution (skip unnecessary steps)
- Adaptive workflows
- Efficient resource use

### Iterative Refinement

**Pattern:** Launch specialist multiple times with refinements.

**Example:** Refactor until no high-priority issues remain

```javascript
let review = new_task(mode: "code-reviewer", message: "Review...")

while (review.highPriority.length > 0) {
  const refactored = new_task(
    mode: "nextjs-architect",
    message: `Refactor these issues: ${review.highPriority}`
  )

  // Re-review after refactoring
  review = new_task(
    mode: "code-reviewer",
    message: `Re-review refactored code: ${refactored}`
  )
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Quality gates enforced
- Iterative improvement
- Ensures standards met

**Limitations:**
- Can run indefinitely (set max iterations)
- Longer execution time
- Context can accumulate

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Pattern:** Orchestrator handles specialist failures gracefully.

**Example:** Fallback if specialist fails

```javascript
try {
  const result = new_task(
    mode: "nextjs-architect",
    message: "Implement complex feature..."
  )
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback: Launch simpler specialist
  const fallback = new_task(
    mode: "react-architect",
    message: "Implement simplified version..."
  )

  // Log warning in final report
  report.warnings.push("Fell back to simplified implementation")
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Resilient workflows
- Graceful degradation
- User still gets results

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Orchestrator says "Mode not found"

**Cause:** Specialist mode not imported into Roo Code

**Solution:**
1. Check mode slug in orchestrator matches specialist YAML
2. Verify specialist YAML file is imported into Roo Code
3. Restart Roo Code / VS Code after import

**Example:**
```javascript
// Orchestrator tries to launch
new_task(mode: "nextjs-architect", ...)

// But specialist file is named "next-architect-export.yaml"
// with slug: "next-architect" (mismatch!)

// Fix: Update orchestrator to use correct slug OR rename specialist slug
```

### Issue: Specialist never returns results

**Cause:** Specialist didn't call `attempt_completion`

**Solution:**
- Always include instruction: "Use attempt_completion when done."
- Check specialist's tool access (can it perform requested task?)
- Review specialist's customInstructions for attempt_completion logic

### Issue: Context passed to specialist is truncated

**Cause:** Result string too large, hitting context limits

**Solution:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå DON'T: Pass huge result strings
new_task(message: `Full context: ${10000_line_result}`)

// ‚úÖ DO: Pass summaries and references
new_task(message: `Summary: ${result.summary}
Key files: ${result.fileList}
Specialist can read files directly for details.`)
```

### Issue: Orchestrator tries to edit files and fails

**Cause:** Orchestrator has wrong tool access groups

**Solution:**
```yaml
# ‚ùå WRONG: Orchestrator with edit access
groups: [read, edit]

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Orchestrator with read-only
groups: [read]

# Then delegate file operations to specialists
```

### Issue: Parallel tasks run sequentially instead

**Cause:** Using sequential syntax instead of parallel

**Solution:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Sequential (waits for each)
const task1 = new_task(mode: "mode1", ...)
const task2 = new_task(mode: "mode2", ...)

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Parallel
const [task1, task2] = Promise.all([
  new_task(mode: "mode1", ...),
  new_task(mode: "mode2", ...)
])
```

### Issue: Specialist doesn't have necessary context

**Cause:** Orchestrator didn't pass context from previous tasks

**Solution:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Missing context
const tests = new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: "Write tests"  // What tests? For what architecture?
)

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Explicit context passing
const tests = new_task(
  mode: "tdd-engineer",
  message: `Write tests for this architecture:

  ${architecture}

  Focus on: ${specificAreas}`
)
```

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### Orchestrator Design Principles

1. **Orchestrators coordinate, specialists execute**
   - Orchestrators: `groups: [read]` (no file edits)
   - Specialists: `groups: [read, edit, command]` (full access)

2. **Explicit is better than implicit**
   - Pass context explicitly between tasks
   - Always include "Use attempt_completion when done"
   - Specify expected output format

3. **Parallel when possible, sequential when necessary**
   - Independent tasks ‚Üí Parallel execution
   - Dependent tasks ‚Üí Sequential with context passing

4. **Quality gates at every phase**
   - Review results from each specialist
   - Conditional launching based on findings
   - Iterative refinement until standards met

### When Orchestration Excels

‚úÖ Multi-step workflows (TDD, design review)
‚úÖ Enforcing methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
‚úÖ Parallel specialist coordination
‚úÖ Comprehensive reporting
‚úÖ Quality gate enforcement

### When Manual Mode Switching is Better

‚úÖ Single focused tasks
‚úÖ Exploratory work
‚úÖ Quick iterations
‚úÖ Learning individual modes
‚úÖ Simple one-off operations

## Quick Reference

### Orchestrator Template

```yaml
customModes:
  - slug: my-orchestrator
    name: üéØ My Orchestrator
    roleDefinition: You coordinate X workflow by launching specialists...
    whenToUse: Use when X workflow needed...
    description: Orchestrates X
    groups: [read]  # Read-only for orchestrators
    customInstructions: >-
      ## Your Role

      Coordinate the X workflow by launching specialists in correct sequence.

      ## Workflow

      ### Phase 1: Setup
      ```javascript
      const setup = new_task(
        mode: "specialist-slug",
        message: "Task description. Use attempt_completion when done."
      )
      ```

      ### Phase 2: Execution
      ```javascript
      const result = new_task(
        mode: "another-specialist",
        message: `Execute based on: ${setup}. Use attempt_completion when done.`
      )
      ```

      ## Aggregation

      Synthesize results into comprehensive report.
```

### Specialist Template

```yaml
customModes:
  - slug: my-specialist
    name: üîß My Specialist
    roleDefinition: You are a specialist for X...
    whenToUse: Use when X task needed...
    description: Performs X
    groups: [read, edit, command]  # Full access for specialists
    customInstructions: >-
      ## Your Role

      Perform X task and return results via attempt_completion.

      ## Tasks

      1. Task A
      2. Task B
      3. Task C

      ## Output Format

      Return structured results:
      - Summary
      - Artifacts (files, code)
      - Any issues encountered

      Use attempt_completion when done.
```
