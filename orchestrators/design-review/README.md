# Design Review Orchestration Modes (7)

These modes coordinate comprehensive design reviews by launching 6 specialist reviewers automatically using Roo Code's Boomerang Tasks.

## üé® Design Review Orchestrator

**File:** [orchestrator-design-review-export.yaml](orchestrator-design-review-export.yaml)

### What It Does
Coordinates 6 specialist design reviewers to perform comprehensive UI/UX validation.

### Workflow
Launches all specialists in **PARALLEL** (since they're independent):

1. **Interaction & Flow Tester** - Tests user flows and interactive states
2. **Responsive Design Auditor** - Tests 3 viewports (desktop, tablet, mobile)
3. **Visual Polish Reviewer** - Checks spacing, alignment, typography consistency
4. **Accessibility Auditor** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
5. **Robustness Tester** - Edge cases, error handling, empty states
6. **Code Health Reviewer** - Component reuse, design tokens, TypeScript quality

### Final Report Structure

## üì¶ Import Instructions

### Import Complete Design Review System
```bash
# You MUST import all 7 files for the orchestrator to work
cat orchestrators/design-review/*.yaml > design-review-system.yaml

# Then import design-review-system.yaml into Roo Code
```

### Import Individual Specialists Only
```bash
# If you want to use specialists independently (no orchestrator)
# Import just the specific reviewers you need
```

**Recommended:** Import the complete system so the orchestrator can coordinate all specialists automatically.

---

## üéØ Example Usage

### Complete Design Review
```
User: "Run a complete design review on the user dashboard"

1. Switch to: orchestrator-design-review mode
2. Provide context: "Review the user dashboard at /dashboard"
3. Orchestrator automatically:
   - Launches all 6 specialists in parallel
   - Collects results from each
   - Aggregates findings by priority
   - Provides comprehensive report with screenshots
   - Gives go/no-go recommendation
```

### Single Specialist Review
```
User: "Check if my form is accessible"

1. Switch to: accessibility-auditor mode
2. Provide context: "Review the form at /signup"
3. Specialist tests:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Color contrast
   - ARIA labels
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Returns WCAG 2.1 AA compliance report
```

---

## üîß Playwright MCP Configuration

Most design review specialists use **Playwright MCP** for live browser testing.

### Setup Required
```bash
# Install Playwright MCP server
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright

# Configure in Roo Code settings
# MCP servers will be auto-detected
```

### What Playwright Enables
- Launch browser in different viewports
- Navigate to pages
- Click elements, fill forms
- Capture screenshots for evidence
- Test keyboard navigation
- Measure color contrast ratios
- Test responsive breakpoints

## üÜö Orchestrator vs Manual Review

| Aspect | Design Review Orchestrator | Manual Specialist Usage |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Specialists Run | All 6 in parallel | One at a time (manual switch) |
| Review Time | Faster (parallel) | Slower (sequential) |
| Report Format | Aggregated by priority | Individual reports |
| Go/No-Go Decision | Automatic recommendation | Manual synthesis |
| Screenshot Evidence | Consolidated | Scattered across reports |

**Recommendation:** Use orchestrator for final pre-merge review. Use individual specialists during active development for targeted feedback.

---

## üìä Design Review Checklist

Before running the orchestrator, ensure:
- [ ] Feature is implemented and tests pass
- [ ] Local dev server is running (for Playwright testing)
- [ ] You can navigate to the pages/components to review
- [ ] Design mockups are available (for visual comparison)
- [ ] You're ready to act on findings (fix blockers before merge)

---

## üé® Integration with TDD Orchestrators

**Design Review is the final validation step in TDD Frontend Orchestrator:**

```
TDD Frontend Orchestrator Flow:
1. Architecture ‚Üí Design component
2. Tests ‚Üí Write failing tests (RED)
3. Implementation ‚Üí Make tests pass (GREEN)
4. Code Review ‚Üí Refactor (REFACTOR)
5. Design Review ‚Üí Final UI/UX validation ‚Üê USES THIS ORCHESTRATOR
```

You can run design review independently OR let TDD Frontend Orchestrator trigger it automatically for UI-heavy features.

---

## üîÑ How It Works (Technical)

**Parallel Execution Pattern:**
```javascript
// Orchestrator launches all 6 specialists at once
const results = await Promise.all([
  new_task(mode: "interaction-tester", message: "Test user flows..."),
  new_task(mode: "responsive-auditor", message: "Test viewports..."),
  new_task(mode: "visual-reviewer", message: "Check visual polish..."),
  new_task(mode: "accessibility-auditor", message: "WCAG compliance..."),
  new_task(mode: "robustness-tester", message: "Test edge cases..."),
  new_task(mode: "code-health-reviewer", message: "Review code quality...")
])

// Aggregates results into priority-ordered report
const report = aggregateFindings(results)
```

**Advantages:**
- 6 specialists complete in time of 1 (parallel execution)
- Consistent reporting format across all specialists
- Automatic prioritization (Blocker ‚Üí High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Nitpick)
- Go/no-go recommendation based on blocker count
